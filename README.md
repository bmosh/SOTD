# SOTD
Spotify API Web App for finding new music! 

Currently, this app asks you to pick a genre, then creates a SOTD playlist, then adds 5 songs from that genre to it using Spotify's recommendation engine. 

Eventually, I hope to turn this into a program that will allow a user to enter keywords describing their day, and gives 5 song recommendations based on these keywords, with the user finally choosing one to add to the playlist each day. The playlist will slowly grow to 365 songs over the year, and the user can look back on their year with music!

GUIDE: TBA
